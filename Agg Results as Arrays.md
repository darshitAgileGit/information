Certainly! When fresher or junior developers are working with MongoDB and using aggregation, they might wonder why aggregation results are returned in an array. Understanding this is important for them to work effectively with MongoDB. 

1. **Consistency**: MongoDB returns aggregation results as an array for consistency. Whether your aggregation query returns one document or a thousand, the result is always an array. This consistency simplifies the code for handling results, as developers can always expect an array and iterate through it, regardless of the number of results.

2. **Flexibility**: Returning results in an array provides flexibility. It allows you to handle multiple documents in a unified way. You can use the same code structure for handling both single-document and multi-document results.

3. **Easier Data Transformation**: Aggregation queries often involve complex operations like grouping, sorting, and filtering. Returning the results in an array makes it easier to process the data further in your application. You can manipulate the array using various programming constructs like loops or higher-order functions.

4. **Simplicity in API Design**: MongoDB's API is designed to be developer-friendly. Returning aggregation results as an array simplifies the API because developers don't need to make distinctions between different result types.

5. **Predictable Structure**: With aggregation, the results can have various shapes and sizes depending on the query. Returning results as an array ensures a predictable structure, making it easier to work with the data in code.

6. **JSON Compatibility**: Results in the form of an array are well-suited to being transformed into JSON. JSON is a common data interchange format used in web applications, and MongoDB's native format aligns well with it.

7. **Error Handling**: In the case of errors or empty results, returning an array still provides a consistent data structure. This simplifies error handling and reduces the need for special cases in your code.

In summary, returning aggregation results as an array in MongoDB is a deliberate design choice that aims to provide consistency, flexibility, and simplicity in handling data. While it might seem unusual at first, it ultimately makes working with MongoDB more intuitive and developer-friendly. Junior developers should embrace this convention and design their code accordingly to effectively work with MongoDB's aggregation framework.
