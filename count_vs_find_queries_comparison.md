What's the difference between the following two queries, and in what scenario should each be used?

1. `await this.goatModel.countDocuments({ userId: user['_id'] });`
2. `await this.goatModel.find({ userId: user['_id'] }).count();`



### Difference:

1. **`countDocuments()`**:
   - This method counts the number of documents that match the query directly in the database.
   - It is more efficient because it only counts the documents and doesn't retrieve them.

2. **`find().count()`**:
   - This method first retrieves the documents that match the query and then counts them.
   - It is less efficient because it loads all the matching documents into memory before counting them, which can slow down performance, especially with large datasets.

### When to Use:
- **Use `countDocuments()`** when you only need the count and donâ€™t require the actual documents (preferred for performance).
- **Use `find().count()`** if you need to retrieve the documents for further processing, and then count them (but try to avoid it for counting purposes alone).
